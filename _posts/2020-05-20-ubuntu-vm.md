Today we're going to learn about a beautiful functionality known as virtualization. I'll be addressing the steps below, if you have any questions please feel free to contact me!

Now, let us begin!

1)  We’re going to download and install Oracle Virtual Box from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

![step1.png](:/ed0fc2e1041845fca56cc6ed0f6cfc55)
 
2)  Next, we’re going to download a beginner-friendly distribution of Linux called Ubuntu https://ubuntu.com/#download 

![step2.png](:/319336a51d654d38a70c119945ea3e77)

3)  After VirtualBox is downloaded and installed we’re going to start it up. From here get familiar with some of the basic VBox menus and buttons.

4)  We’re going to create a new Virtual Machine by clicking ![new.png](:/474703090a3e4f4fa002e1a8f315e27c)

    

  - Then the following screen should appear *Make sure to type Ubuntu in the Name: field*

  - Hit **Continue**

5)  Next, we’re going to allocate the memory (RAM) for our machine
I usually do 4gb because my host machine can handle it but, for this example, we’ll keep it at 1gb (1024mb)

6)  Now, we’re going to create our virtual hard disk. I usually do 20gb but for this example, we’ll keep it at 10gb

7)  Next, the screen we’ll decide what type of hard disk. For this example, I’m keeping it at VDI.

8)  We’re going to keep the storage as Dynamic.

![step8.png](:/2b873d4ecc824690a78f74815cba11b1)

9)  This next screen just sets where you want to save your virtual hard disk and how much memory to allocate it.

![step9.png](:/f5e06dee1b9e4368aab0d3e94fb693eb)

10) Once we hit Create we will see the following screen… We’re going to start this machine by clicking![start.png](:/9c0f1715c30548c2afdfbeeba7c976e0)

   

![step10.png](:/32bb5e8c182e48c58303aabffd566e14)

11) Now, we’re going to add our medium to the virtual optical disk (the ubuntu file we downloaded earlier) then click start.

![step11.png](:/1436126cfc434476902389b59ff5485d)

12) Ubuntu should have booted up and you should get the following screen.
From here you can play around with Trying Ubuntu, but for this walkthrough, we’re going to install Ubuntu.

![step12.png](:/13bbbdd0b73b4cd2b3ff16b67667d604)

13) We’re going to follow through the prompts, by selecting your keyboard layout and language.

![step13.png](:/01e58432c3544a73a99e2343f5ff5ea6)

14) Then we’re going to perform a Normal Installation and we’re going to download updates and install 3rd party software while installing Ubuntu.  This makes the installation take a little longer, but it saves us sometime later down the road.

15) Next, we’re going to “Erase Disk and install Ubuntu”. It sounds scary, but since we’re in a VM our host machine is safe. Click Install Now then Continue

![step15a.png](:/1c6fe88367c741f6add8d2bcec4a7707)

16) Next, set your time zone. 

![step16.png](:/9295b7cd995f48d79f2f9e0807443977)

17) Set up your login info and set a strong password!

![step17.png](:/37e21ceb6eb2454d84b6f8dd7581efa5)

18) Once the install is completed restart your VM.

19) Congratulations, you’ve just installed Ubuntu onto a Virtual Machine!

20) Before you start enjoying your new Operating System we need to perform one more thing. 
  - Open up your Ubuntu Terminal by going to the applications menu on the bottom left.
  - Type in the following command sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt update -y
  
![step20b.png](:/1cf7920790e44051918541f412fe8bd5)
 
*It’ll ask for your password, use the password you created on step 17*
